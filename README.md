The way i created the final version of my web page was taking the excisting branch three home page and keeping all the java script to load the pokemon onto the home page. To create the web page pokemon full image display for every pokemon without a page refresh i crated a click function the inserts a pop up div on top of the excisting content thats there. I also took the static pokemon full page from branch three and dynamically added it to to the page for the pop up. One struggle i had while creating this web page was activating the load more function after i have exited a pop up pokemon page. The second struggle that I am having was on the pop up page click the left and right buttons to cycle throught the previous and next pokemon without going back to the home page. Another problem i am having is that i set the primary and secondary type values to images, but when the pokemon does not have a secondary type it still tries to pass through an image, i try to set it as an empty string but since the src tag is still there an image is still trying to load onto the page. The last problem i am having is that the mini pokemon menu selector on the pop up page stopped working, although i didnt touch the code for this menu. The resources i used for this assignment were the pokemonAPI, icons from FontAwsome, and Google Fonts.
